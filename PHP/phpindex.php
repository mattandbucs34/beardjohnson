					<p>Erin and I started talking through Match.com. I had poor timing because as soon as Erin and I started chatting, she went on a trip to China for a wedding. I thought, “Ok. That’s cool. She’ll probably forget about me and I won’t hear from her again.” I was wrong. The day after she got back, Erin reached out to me. We shot messages back and forth for ten days (according to Erin) before I asked her to lunch. I was at work one day and I thought that meeting for lunch was a good idea. I decided to go to Red Robin Burgerworks since it was close to my work. I showed up a few minutes early so I sat on a bench outside to wait for her. I saw her drive by as she was looking for a parking spot. At this point, I was pretty excited. I waited for her to park. She got out of her car and came my way. I went from excited to nervous in no time flat. I thought Erin was just that beautiful. Needless to say, the date didn’t go all that well because I couldn’t maintain eye contact and I was nervous to the point that I couldn’t keep the conversation going. When we left, Erin was nice enough to give me a kiss. I thought that was a pretty big win considering the poor initial meeting. Luckily for me, she agreed to a second date a week later. I decided to take her to Dave & Buster’s to help liven up the mood. This time, I didn’t feel nervous. We had an excellent time and I like to say that Erin fell in love with me that night. The rest has been history because I haven’t let her go. She’s been a strong woman for me and we’ve both helped each other grow both individually as well as within our relationship. </p>
